Thank you for downloading!

To install:
- Drag the files from inside the MAIN MOD - COLOR CHANGE folder to your World of Tanks install directory (by default, C:\Games\World_of_Tanks).

IMPORTANT NOTE: Only the tanks that are currently in HD have the color swap. The non-HD tanks still have their default blue color. Since WG is going to rework them into HD at some point anyways, I'd rather not have to re-do the mod twice for those tanks. Plus, the color shows up weird since they use the old model/texture system.

Enjoy!
